## 2. Wait for Pull Request to merge

## 3. Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!

- Always make more than 4 pull requests.
- Let's say you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and then you have the remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects are not excluded.
- If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
I will recommend you make a pull request to your own repo which is very very safe for you.
- Keep in mind that the repo has hacktoberfest topic.
